HTML5/CSS - Building a branded site with linked multi pages
I am wanting to set up a mystical wish / cards website.
Learning how to make a good link directory, possible product page, link pops, etc.
Wanting to learn how to make the background images fit with the pages better, possibly scroll with page, etc.
